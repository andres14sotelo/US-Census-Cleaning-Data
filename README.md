# US-Census-Cleaning-Data
This project consists of cleaning the dataset from the US Census from Codecademy. There's ten datasets so I had to pull everything together and merge into one big dataset. In the original dataset, there were missing values, duplicate values, unnecessary columns, and unnecessary characters within each observation.
